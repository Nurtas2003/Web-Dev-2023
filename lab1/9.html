<h2 id="when">When to go?</h2>
<p class="hawaii"> <em>Hawaii</em> lies in the zone of eternal summer, so the temperature here stays around +25 ... +32 ° C all year round, and even at night it gets slightly colder (but you should take warm clothes, especially if you plan a trip to the mountains). But according to the amount of precipitation, the season is divided into dry and wet: from April to October there is almost no rain, from <strong>November</strong> to March there is. The water in the ocean heats up to +23 °C in winter and +27 °C in summer.</p>

<p>There are not enough classic attractions on the islands: lovers of architecture and art will have to be content with the Iolani Palace (off. site in English), the Polynesian Cultural Center (off. site in English), the Bishop Museum (off. site in English), as well as the Pearl Base -Harbor (off. site in English), a film about which at one time became a cult. But for connoisseurs of nature here is a real expanse.

    On the Big Island, it is worth visiting the Volcanoes National Park (official website in English), trying to conquer Mauna Kea and admiring the very active Kilauea volcano, on Oahu - going to the Diamond Head Reserve. On Kauai, you can walk along the Waimea Canyon and appreciate the unearthly beauty of the Na Pali coast from the board of a kayak or boat.</p>
